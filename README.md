# SimpleWindowsForm
This project demonstrates a basic understanding of Windows Form Creation and C# to program buttons, Text Boxes, and events. This will be the first in a series of Windows Application creation culminating in my Senior Project. 

This simple windows form includes a timer with a start, stop, and exit buttons. It also provides Text Boxes for user input.

Things to notes:
You must enter all data in the TextBoxes before you can hit the accept button.
You can only enter integers in the zip text box.
If you pause the timer, it will disable the text boxes, and you will not be able to use them until you hit start again.
